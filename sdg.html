            <h2>SDG Goal 10: REDUCE INEQUALITY</h2>
            <p class="sdg-description">
                Reduced Inequalities aims to reduce inequality within and among countries by 2030. This goal focuses on ensuring equal opportunities, combating social, economic, and political inequalities, and promoting social inclusion, regardless of age, gender, race, or disability. It seeks to create fairer societies where everyone can thrive and benefit from progress and opportunities.

                    <h3>HOW MY SKILLS ALIGN WITH SDG No.10</h3>
                    <p>
                        As an Information Technology student, I see technology as a powerful tool to break down barriers and create a world where equality isn’t just a dream but a reality. My passion lies in using tech-driven solutions to address social and economic disparities, ensuring that everyone, regardless of race, age, gender, or background, has a fair shot at success.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've had the opportunity to work on projects where digital tools became lifelines for communities in need—bridging gaps in education, communication, and employment. Whether it’s developing a mobile app that connects job seekers to employers or creating platforms that make learning accessible to everyone, I've seen firsthand how technology can drive meaningful change.

                    <p>
                        My mission is to scale up these initiatives, collaborating with communities to build digital ecosystems that foster inclusion, amplify voices that often go unheard, and create opportunities where none existed. I’m committed to turning challenges into opportunities, empowering marginalized groups, and driving progress towards a society where everyone has an equal chance to thrive.
